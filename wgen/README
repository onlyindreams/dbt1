0. What is this document?

This is the general README file for TPCW, a sample implementation of
some of the database-population-generation routines required in TPCW. 

1. What is TPCW?

TPCW is a sample database population program for use with the TPC-W
benchmarks.  It is written in ANSI 'C' for portability, and is based on
code that has been successfully ported to over a dozen different systems. 
The source code has been provided to make the process of building a compliant 
database population as simple as possible.

2. What will TPCW create?

TPCW is meant as a sample of the types of functionality that will be required
in a database generator for the TPC-W benchmark. It produces sample
output for two of the fields in the benchmark defintion, A_LNAME and I_TITLE. 
The number of samples produces, along with related variable settings like 
number of items and authors can be set from the command line. 
All output is sent to stdout.

3. How is TPCW built?

The source code for TPCW is contained in the following files:
	rnd.[ch]	A portable random-number generator
	text.c		Pseudo-text generation routines
	tpcw.[ch]	The TPC-W-specific routines
	bm_utils.c	Generic routines based on those used in TPC-D's DBGEN
	main.c		A simple driver routine
	
To build TPCW on a new system, do the following:
	1. Create an appropriate makefile, using makefile.suite as a basis.
	2. make.  

Note: The required changes to the makefile should be limited to the first 
few lines. 

4. Command Line Options for TPCW

TPCW's output is controlled by a combination of command line options
and environment variables. Command line options are assumed to be single
letter flags preceded by a minus sign. They may be followed by an
optional argument.

option  argument    default     action
------  --------    -------     ------
-h                                Display a usage summary

-s      <samples>   1             Number of sample generated

-a      <authors>   250           Set the number of authors

-i      <items>     1000          Set the number of items

-d      <file>      grammar.tpcw  Read distributions from <file>

-m      <mode>      0             Set the output mode. Defined modes are:
								   0 -- I_TITLE
								   1 -- A_LNAME

5. Environment Variables

Enviroment variables are used to control features of TPCW
that are unlikely to change from one execution to another.

Variable    Default     Action
-------     -------     ------
TPCW_CONFIG  .             Directory in which to find configuration files
TPCW_DIST   grammar.tpcw   Name of distribution definition file
