Problem #00008: closed
Summary:      synthetic words are sometime removed in mk_title()
    since mk_title adds a whole word (with a space) the insertion point can
	cause the resulting string to be too long. If that happens it's trimmed
	back to a word boundary, and the output of digsyl() can be removed.
